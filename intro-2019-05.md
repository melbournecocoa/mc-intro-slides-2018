# Asking great questions

- Ask questions not comments
- Make questions polite that contribute to the discussion
- Nobody knows all the answers!


^ Many of our speakers take questions after their talk. Question time an opportunity to learn more, not to get up and share your own opinion - So please ask concise questions, not give comments. 

^ Good questions should contribute to the discussion and allow us all to learn. Our speakers are knowledgeable, but they don’t know everything, so “I don’t know” is always an acceptable answer.  

^ Audience members shouldn’t try and catch out the speakers with a difficult questions they can’t answer. Instead be supportive of speakers.

^ There are many opportunities after the talks or on slack to chat to the speaker and discuss your question or thoughts further. Please approach the speaker with respect when you do this and understand if they cannot have a full discussion at that time.

# CocoaHeads - Next

- Transition Meetup was held on April 16th
- TL;DR:
    - We're moving towards a more distributed approach (distributed systems are more resilient 🤓)
    - Rotating event-based team, more people involved
    - Dedicated team of advocates to reach out to Students and Juniors
    - Anyone can be a MC!
