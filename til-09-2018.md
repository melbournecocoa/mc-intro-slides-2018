The `Progress` class

```swift
- (void)startTaskWithData:(NSData *)data {
    NSUInteger batchSize = ... use a suitable batch size
    NSProgress *progress = [NSProgress progressWithTotalUnitCount:batchSize];
 
    for (NSUInteger index = 0; index < batchSize; index++) {
        // Check for cancellation
        if ([progress isCancelled]) {
             // Tidy up as necessary...
             break;
        }
 
        // Do something with this batch of data...
 
        // Report progress (add 1 because we've completed the work for the current index).
        [progress setCompletedUnitCount:(index + 1)];
    }
}
```
